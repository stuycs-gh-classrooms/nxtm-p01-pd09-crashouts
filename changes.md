- We added our classes and the methods/instances. We added a new feature where the game gets harder as the points progress.
- Started on the Class of Ball and Block
- Finished class Ball and Block
- Finished class Racket
- Added Levels
- Change the spawn place of the ball to be random
- Change the background to random rgb when you reach the next level
- Fixed an issue where the ball speed and racket size would reset after losing a life, so difficulty now stays consistent for the current level.
- Increased ball speed and decreased racket size as levels progress to make the game harder.
- Made Level 3 the final level, where the screen flashes RGB colors and the game becomes extremely difficult.
